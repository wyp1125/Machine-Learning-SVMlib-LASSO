# Machine-Learning-SVMlib-LASSO
A compile of Perl and R scripts for applying machine learning techniques including SVM and LASSO.

These programs were originally developed for a project for predicting enhancers from DNA motif signatures generated by TFSearch. The software SVMlib was used for implementing the SVM models.
