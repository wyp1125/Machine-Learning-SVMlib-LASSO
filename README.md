# Machine-Learning-SVMlib-LASSO
A compile of Perl and R scripts for applying machine learning techniques including SVM and LASSO.

These programs were originally developed for a project for predicting enhancers from DNA motif signatures generated by TFSearch. The software SVMlib was used for implementing the SVM models.

1. SVM tools

a) train_SVM_model.pl 

A perl script which calls SVMlib to train linear SVM models for predicting enhancers from TFSearch outputs.

b) test_SVM_model.pl

A perl script which calls SVMlib to predict enhancers for new datasets based on the SVM model generated by "train_SVM_model.pl". 

c) get_SVM_feature_weight.pl 
A perl script to generate the weight for each feature

2. LASSO tools
