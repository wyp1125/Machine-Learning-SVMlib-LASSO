# Machine-Learning-libSVM-LASSO
A compile of Perl and R scripts for applying machine learning techniques including SVM and LASSO.

These programs were originally developed for a project for predicting enhancers from DNA motif signatures generated by TFSearch. The software libSVM was used for implementing the SVM models.

1. SVM tools

a) train_SVM_model.pl 

A perl script which calls libSVM to train linear SVM models for predicting enhancers from TFSearch outputs.

b) test_SVM_model.pl

A perl script which calls libSVM to predict enhancers for new datasets based on the SVM model generated by "train_SVM_model.pl". 

c) get_SVM_feature_weight.pl 

A perl script to generate the weight for each feature

2. LASSO tools

a) make_lasso_fea.pl 

A perl script to generate training data for the LASSO model from TFSearch outputs.

b) make_lasso_fea.pl

A perl script to generate prediction data from TFSearch outputs.

c) lasso.R

R script to implement the LASSO model.
